Hey, I'm Peter! I'm a Ph.D. student at MIT CSAIL, advised by [Prof. Mengjia Yan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mengjia/). My current research interests broadly lie in computer architecture and security, with a particular focus on quantifying and defending against architectural side-channels.  

Before coming to MIT, I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of British Columbia, where I worked with [Prof. Mieszko Lis](http://mieszko.ece.ubc.ca/) and [Prof. Prashant Nair](https://prashantnair.bitbucket.io/). I've also spent a number of years in industry, working on ASIC design/verification at Intel and Microsemi, and researching cryptographic key extraction schemes using [novel Physical Unclonable Functions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13389-019-00208-4) at Bosch.

When I'm not in the lab, you can find me [scrambling up the Rockies](assets/img/rockies.jpg), [canoeing down the Charles River](assets/img/canoe.jpg), or [wrangling Elliot](assets/img/elliot.jpg).
